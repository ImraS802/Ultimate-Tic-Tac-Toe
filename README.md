# Ultimate-Tic-Tac-Toe - GA Project One - 5 Days
Brief
The game is a 3x3 board.
The game starts with the player who has the circle as symbol. The other player has a triangle as symbol.
The player should have three of their own symbols displayed in the grid in a row or column or diagonal.
The player who won should be displayed at the end of the game.


Skills
JavaScript, HTML, CSS.

Features
Pop up message which announces the winner below the board game.
The combination of cells which wins is highlighted by a line.

Building Process
I started sketching a wireframe as a first draft. 

Known Errors and Bugs
With the limited time (5 days instead of 7), I have prioritized functionality over game design or features such as sounds or special effects. I also needed to limit the game to the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. 


Challenges
Some of the interesting challenges I faced during development:
Thinking about the different winning possibilities and how to display them including the option of a draw.
In JS targeting the right elements of the html and applying the right functionalities.


Wins
My biggest wins:
At first I wanted to work with winner and draw alerts but after researching I found that there are more elegant solutions like using appearing and disappearing elements on the page.
Using Object oriented programming.


Key Learnings
Working with data-index in html and JS.
I improved my understanding on how to use the DOM and JS. 
Even though I had a draft how the game should look like and what functions/ elements I want to use - during the process of buildung it it was constantly changing so I couldn't stick to my initial draft completely.
